# Product Demo Script

## Examples:
- Poppin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBmixVxwgrk
- Face control: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzsYVqmmDu70cE5TRXZSaHpFTkE/view

## Technical Planning: 
- Jason can bring a Blue Yeti for voiceovers 
- We can record B-roll on anyone's phone really 
- We can live demo on someone's Android phone or screen record on a computer 
- YouTube unlisted video probably most convenient upload method 
- Editing software? Not sure haven't edited videos before
- Discussed during meeting we'd do infomercial style and use less scripted portion for introduction. 

## Introduction
- Give the audience some context 
- Tell the audience what they are about to watch

[14sec] In a world full of choices and decisions, we wanted to make it easier for you to make the decisions that really matter: where to go to eat.
Have you ever wanted to find somewhere new to eat, but couldn’t decide where? Here we have Steve who always eats the same thing everyday.
[8sec]	Steve: I always eat poutine from the Blue food truck. But, I’m getting tired of it and want to try something new. I don’t really know any places that are similar to what I already like.
[7sec] Have you ever been with a group of friends and couldn’t find a place you all agreed on? Here we have Cameron and his friends.
	
[13sec]Cameron: Hey everyone, wanna grab lunch together?
Steve: Sure, I’m good with anything, just not poutine again.
Cameron: Hmmm I’m not a huge fan of Indian food.
Bob: As for me, I tend to like sushi. 
Cameron: Well with all these different likes and dislikes, how can we decide on a restaurant to eat?

[7sec] Or maybe you’re in a new area and wanted to discover a place around you? Here we have Bob who is on campus for the very first time.
	
[12sec]Bob: Wow campus is so cool! But I’m hungry and I’m not sure what’s good around me. I want something closeby but I don’t want to just blindly walk into the first place I see. What should I do?

[23sec] For all of these problems and more, we’ve developed Foodr. Foodr is your personal food companion app that can suggest a restaurant tailored to your likes and dislikes. Existing food recommendation services such as Yelp, Zomato, or TripAdvisor tend to focus on entering search queries and reading through reviews. We know that for many people this can be overwhelming, which is why we simplified the process and moved the focus to the dishes themselves. 

## Demo
- Demonstrate your product
- Present it from the user’s perspective, and guide the audience through the most common user flow.

Here we have the start screen of Foodr. From here, users has the option to immediately start finding places to eat, or open up the settings menu and choose a price range if the default doesn’t work for them. Upon clicking the start screen, Foodr will immediately present you with images of various dishes. The initial few represent different cuisines are used to get a baseline reading of a user’s likes and dislikes. Simply swipe left to discard a picture or swipe right to like it. Users can also press the buttons instead of swiping. After a couple of quick swipes, based on your individual preferences, Foodr will begin displaying pictures of actual dishes from various restaurants around your current location. Once again, simply swipe left to discard a picture or swipe right to like it. When Foodr is confident you will like a restaurant, Foodr will present you with the selection and give you the option to navigate to it right away.

## Final discussion
- Summarize what we saw
- Briefly discuss what you’re planning to do next

[19sec] In our next and final iteration, these are the features we plan to add to our product.
Firstly, we want to allow users to reject a result and continue searching in order to get a more tailored result. Second, we want to include more options for user customization such as a distance parameter. Lastly we want to expand our restaurant recommendation to include more photos.
