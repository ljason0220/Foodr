## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Oct. 13, 2017
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * Having the group chat has been great for being able to quickly contact and reach other members. We had to switch ideas during our Oct. 2 meeting due to us realizing the our initial product was not as great as we thought it was and, as a result, our planning timeline had to be pushed back. To catch up on lost progress, we made extensive use of the group chat which allowed us to share and discuss our new ideas as well as decide on details as a group outside of our established meeting times.
 
 * We established that whenever we share ideas we should also justify them as to how they would directly benefit our users. This kept our mindset revolved around our use cases and kept our ideas focused.
 
 * Even without an explicit schedule or task list, we were still able to complete tasks as needed due to how open everyone was with communication. Everyone was diligent and updated each other on their progress.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped
 
 * We should have established a schedule and task list right from the start. From our planning meeting, this was one of our lowest priority goals. A lot of our goals revolved around brainstorming ideas or making decisions so we thought the concrete task list could come later. However, we still had tasks that needed to be done and no mechanism to assign them to team members and track completion.
 
 * Our attempts at online meetings were relatively successful, but moving forward we should probably specify an explicit meeting start time and end time instead of just saying "Oct. 9 evening" or "Oct. 13 afternoon". We had a much more sparse conversation than we would have gotten from an in person meeting because not everyone was simultaneously online so we had to wait for people to respond before moving forward. A lot of our major decisions occurred outside of established meeting times due to this. 

#### Planned changes

 * Establish a schedule and a more concrete task list. Having this task list was our lowest priority goals so we ended up delaying the task of creating the task list. Having this will allow us to be more aware of what we are each responsible for and plan our own time accordingly.
 
 * Be more explicit about online meeting times. We were unfortunately rather vague about when our online meetings would be, so everyone would be in and out of the conversation. We were still able to effectively make decisions, but it was not as efficient as it could have been.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * Exchange contact info and decide on method of communication
    * We decided on Facebook messenger as our method of communication
 * The completion of the following goals were documented in our product proposal:
    * Decide on a product idea
    * Develop high level use cases
    * Decide what features will make up our minimum viable product
 * Decide what platform we want to build our product on
    * We decided on building an Android app
 * Decide what language we want to use
    * As an Android app, the most naturally language to use would be Java

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * Decide how and where we will organize schedules and assign tasks
    * This was our lowest priority goal, but it is still unfortunate that we were unable to complete it since in retrospect it should have been a much higher priority goal. We were unable to complete this goal largely due to the delay that occurred from having to switch product ideas during our Oct. 2 meeting and due to our online meetings that were not as efficient as they could have been. We made up for it by assigning tasks through the group chat and following up on them by requesting updates.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * Establish a schedule and a task list. As mentioned before, this was our lowest priority goal but would have been much more helpful earlier on in the process. This ensures that tasks in future iterations will be much more manageable and trackable. 
 * Have more established meetings with explicitly set times. This will ensure that our meetings are more efficient and also allow for more in-depth conversation that involves everyone in the group at once.
