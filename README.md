# Foodr

Foodr is a mobile application designed to cater the needs of individuals who want a fun, fast, and easy way to find a new place to eat that they have never been to before. Foodr is a mobile app for Android OS that utilizes location data, Google Places API, and Yelp Fusion API to present personalized eating recommendations for the user. The estimated usage time from launching the app to making a decision will be less than 2 minutes.

A common use case could be if Simon and his coworker were looking for a new lunch spot closeby during their hour break for a change of pace, Simon could easily input a filter for restaurants within a certain radius of his office and swipe through some dishes. Foodr would then present a restaurant that Simon could either swipe right and quickly start navigation to, or swipe left and Foodr will present another personalized option. Another example use case would be when Ryan is looking for a cheaper dinner option, but wants to try something new. Ryan could open up the app, easily input a filter for budget restrictions, and only be presented with restaurants heâ€™s never seen before. Foodr would then suggest a personalized restaurant for Ryan and he could either swipe right to accept or left to be shown another option.

Foodr chooses a restaurant based on the user's preferences, providing a customized decision the user is sure to love!
